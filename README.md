# next-technology-frontend-app

## Fetch results from Apple api and render on frontend

A frontend app in React to display search results from an Apple search api. Express static file serving was used in this project

## ðŸ¤” How do I use this?

<details>
<summary>Hey- before you actually use this, make sure you've [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running. Expand to read more</summary>
<br>
### ðŸš¨ ENV VARS

This project uses environment variables, but if you are using docker you can ignore these as they have already been set

1. PORT
2. NODE_ENV

Once you have each of these, you're all set!

</details>

### Step 1: Build Image

In your project directory, run

```sh
docker build --tag next-app-frontend-castro:latest .
```

### Step 2: Verify Image

When build is complete you can verify your image with:

```sh
docker images
```

Then run your image with (make sure port 4000 is free on your local machine):

```sh
docker run -p 4000:9000 -d --name next-app-frontend-castro next-app-frontend-castro
```

### Step 3: Follow Logs

#### Run following commands to follow logs

```sh
docker ps
docker logs next-app-frontend-castro
```

#### If you need to go inside the container you can use the exec command:

```sh
docker exec -it next-app-frontend-castro /bin/bash
```

### Step 4: Open Postman and try out the api

First do a curl

```sh
curl -i localhost:4000/health
```

You should get a `HEALTHY!!!!!` response. You can open Postman (to make it easier) and test your the api

The endpoint for getting the search results is `localhost:4000/api/search?searchTerm=burna`

## You can skip all the above setup and test the deploy prod endpoints at:

```sh
curl -i https://l788umca3c.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/
```

> Please note, you require a `X-ID` header in other to identify the current user. Possible values are listed above

```sh
curl https://l788umca3c.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/streams -H "X-ID: 123"
```

# Scaling strategy

This api uses AWS Lambda, Lambda automatically scales out for incoming requests, if all existing execution contexts (lambda instances) are busy. Also we can use AWS Lambda with an Application Load Balancer,

We can also use Application Auto Scaling. Application Auto Scaling allows us to configure automatic scaling for different resources, including Provisioned Concurrency for Lambda. We can scale resources based on a specific CloudWatch metric or at a specific date and time.

# Logging & monitoring

This api implements `CloudWatch` logs to help in logging and monitoring at scale. The api uses `winston-cloudwatch` to send specific logs to `CloudWatch` under a log group name.

The `Log Group Name` is unique and the `Log Streams Name` is also unique to aid in filtering and setting metrics.

Every other `stdout` goes to to a different `Log Group`
